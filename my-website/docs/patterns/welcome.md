# Welcome to DSA Patterns

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on Data Structures and Algorithms patterns! This documentation is designed to help you master the most important coding patterns that frequently appear in technical interviews.

## How to Use This Guide

Each pattern in this documentation follows a structured approach:

1. **Pattern Introduction**: Understanding what the pattern is and when to use it
2. **Core Concepts**: Key ideas and techniques behind the pattern
3. **Implementation**: Step-by-step guide on how to implement the pattern
4. **Common Problems**: Real interview questions that use this pattern
5. **Practice Problems**: Additional problems to reinforce your understanding

## Learning Path

We recommend following these steps for each pattern:

1. Read the pattern introduction and understand the core concepts
2. Study the implementation details and example code
3. Try solving the example problems without looking at the solutions
4. Review the solutions and understand different approaches
5. Practice with similar problems to reinforce your learning

## Getting Started

Select a pattern from the sidebar to begin your learning journey. Each pattern is carefully documented with examples and practice problems to help you master the concept.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
